## 1. Project overview

A compact single-page product management tool built with vanilla
JavaScript and `localStorage`. Users can create product entries (title,
price, taxes, ads fees, discount, category), compute total price, create
multiple copies of a product via `count`, edit, delete single products,
delete all, and search by title or category.

**Primary goals:** - Simple CRUD operations persisted in
`localStorage`. - Instant price calculation (client-side) for better
UX. - Lightweight, dependency-free code that is easy to read and extend.

**Limitations:** - All storage is local to the browser (`localStorage`)
--- not shared between devices or users. - No server-side validation,
concurrency control, or user accounts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Data model & storage

Products are stored as an array in `localStorage.product` in JSON form.
Each product object has the following fields:

``` json
{
  "title": "string (lowercase)",
  "price": "string (number as string)",
  "taxes": "string",
  "ads": "string",
  "discount": "string",
  "total": "string or number",
  "count": "string (number as string)",
  "category": "string (lowercase)"
}
```

**Notes:** - Numeric values are stored as strings (because they come
from `input.value`). Consider normalizing to numbers before storing to
avoid coercion bugs. - `title` and `category` are normalized to
lowercase to make searching case-insensitive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. UI elements and expectations

Key DOM elements the script depends on (IDs/classes must match): -
`#title`, `#price`, `#taxes`, `#ads`, `#discount`, `#total`, `#count`,
`#category`, `#submit` - `#tbody` --- where product rows render. -
`#deleteAll` --- container for the bulk-delete button. - `#search` ---
input used by the search functions.

Assumptions: - `total` is a visible element (not an input) used to show
computed sum. - `count` is an integer-like input used only when creating
products (not during updates).
